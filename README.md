2. `src/core/interfaces`:- This folder is used to kept interfaces for your features. 
3. `src/core/modals`:- This folder is used to kept modals for your features. 
4. `src/core/interceptoprs`:- This folder is used to kept interceptoprs for your features. 
5. `src/core/guards`:- This folder is used to add auth guard for routing. 

### src/shared

1. `src/core/components`:- To add common components across all the modules eg. card component
2. `src/core/pipes`:- To add common pipes across all the modules eg. arrayToString pipe
3. `src/core/services`:- To add common services across all the modules eg. loader service to handle loader for your project

### src/feature-modules

`src/feature-modules` is used to add all your the feature modules into this folder. As a sample we have provided sample code for feature module in this branch- [Sample code](https://github.com/coditas-llp/angular-starter/tree/sample)

## Running unit tests
